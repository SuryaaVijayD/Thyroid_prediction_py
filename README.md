# Thyroid Prediction ML Program
This repository contains a machine learning program for predicting thyroid disorders based on patient data. The program utilizes various machine learning algorithms to classify whether a patient has a thyroid disorder or not.

# Overview
Thyroid disorders are prevalent health conditions affecting millions worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment. This machine learning program aims to assist healthcare professionals in predicting thyroid disorders by analyzing patient data.

# Features
Utilizes machine learning algorithms for thyroid disorder prediction.
Supports univariate and bivariate analysis for specific labels.
Provides insights into feature importance for better understanding of prediction outcomes.
Easily extendable and customizable for different datasets and models.

# Usage
### Data Preparation: 
Prepare your dataset containing patient data. Ensure that it includes relevant features such as TSH, T3, T4 levels, age, sex, etc.

### Preprocessing: 
Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, categorical variables, and normalization as necessary.

### Training: 
Train the machine learning model using the provided scripts or integrate the algorithms into your own workflow.

### Evaluation: 
Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Prediction: 
Use the trained model to make predictions on new data to classify whether a patient is likely to have a thyroid disorder or not.

# Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
## Univariate Analysis
Univariate analysis involves examining the relationship between a single independent variable and the target variable (thyroid disorder). This analysis helps understand the individual impact of each feature on the prediction outcome. For example, you can perform univariate analysis to investigate how TSH levels alone correlate with the likelihood of a thyroid disorder.

## Bivariate Analysis
Bivariate analysis explores the relationship between two variables and how they jointly affect the target variable. In the context of thyroid disorder prediction, bivariate analysis can reveal insights such as the interaction between TSH levels and patient age or the correlation between T3 and T4 levels. Understanding these relationships can enhance the model's predictive accuracy and provide valuable insights for diagnosis.
